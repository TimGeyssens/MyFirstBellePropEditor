# My First Property Editor For Umbraco Belle #
A char limit textarea used is various datatype/prop editor examples around the years now available for Belle

You need to run a build of Belle that has the commits of 17/9/2013 in them since there have been some changes (prop editors require a unique alias not a guid anymore)
